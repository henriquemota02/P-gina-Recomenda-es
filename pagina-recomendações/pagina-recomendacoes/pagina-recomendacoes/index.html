            <h2 class="primeiro">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
                in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
            <h3 class="primeiroh3">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</h3>

            <h3 class="segundoh31">“ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really enjoy, and make a good living

            <h2 class="terceiro2">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
                learning from their experiences was easy.</h2>
            <h3 class="terceiroh32">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
                gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
                junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
                an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</h3>

            <h2 class="quarto3">The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h2>
            <h3 class="quartoh33"> “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer 
                for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</h3>

            <h2 class="quinto4">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
            <h3 class="quintoh34">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                100% recommend! ”</h3>
